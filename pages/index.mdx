# Subrat Subedi

Hello there! My name is Subrat, and I'm currently a senior at [**University of South Dakota**](https://usd.edu) pursuing a major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.
I enjoy learning and working with data and infrastructure, making it more robust by deep-diving into the system.

Feel free to reach out on [**Linkedin**](https://linkedin.com/in/subedisubrat) or through [**email**]().
